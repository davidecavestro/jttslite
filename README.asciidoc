JTTS lite is a desktop time tracking application.
It helps you to trace your daily tasks. It can also generate reports, import and export data.

This project is a complete rewrite of the application using Griffon and an H2 relational database.

The project home is hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jttslite/.
