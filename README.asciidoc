JTTS lite is a desktop time tracking application.
It helps you to trace your daily tasks. It can also generate reports, import and export data.

The project home is hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jttslite/.

Please note at the moment the project is ON HOLD.

This repo at https://github.com/davidecavestro/jttslite hosts a complete rewrite of the application using Griffon and an H2 relational database.

The production repo is still CVS-backed on SF, exported to github just for convenience at https://github.com/davidecavestro/jttslite-legacy
